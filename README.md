# Multi-Agent GenAI Stock Analysis with CrewAI

This project demonstrates a **multi-agent Generative AI workflow** using **CrewAI**. Multiple AI agents collaborate to analyze publicly traded stocks and make investment recommendations.

## Concept

Instead of a single AI model doing everything, multiple agents work together, each with a defined role:

- **Task:** Analyze stocks and make recommendations  
- **Agents:**  
  - Agent 1: Prepares detailed stock reports  
  - Agent 2: Decides whether to **Buy, Sell, or Hold**  
- **Tool:** Uses **yfinance** to pull real-time stock data  

This setup illustrates how breaking problems into tasks, assigning agents, and providing the right tools makes AI workflows **smarter, faster, and highly automated**.
